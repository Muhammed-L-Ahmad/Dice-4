# dice-roll-4-forms

This is a rails app to simulate a dice roll game using query forms from a template for my bootcamp. I had made several variations of the dice games throughout the course to learn different specific things.  This time, from the template I had to use dynamic path segments to make the app able to respond to any number of http requests, and then refactor it at the end to make the code more concise.  But when I first did this exercise I set it to Private because I thought pro devs would laugh at it, and now it's saying I can't switch it to public.  So I just copied it and re-uploaded everything.  I'll just make my work public in the future.
